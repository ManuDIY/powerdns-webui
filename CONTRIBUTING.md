# Branch Protocol #

Please fork from the `dev` branch for submitting code changes. 

The `dev` branch is regularly merged into the `master` branch.

The `master` is the current stable development version. That is, it regularly changes, but if you clone it, it should work OK.

Stable releases are published and tagged - available from the `release` tab.
